Welcome to your new gem! In this directory, you'll find the files you need to be able to package up your Ruby library into a gem. Put your Ruby code in the file `lib/project_name`. To experiment with that code, run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'project_name'
```

And then execute:

  cd game_project


Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install game_project

## Usage

You will then be directed to use 2 commands to either continue to use the program or to simply exit. Once a command has been selected. You will be prompted in  one of 2 ways.

1. You will receive a list asking for a specific input to read more about the information included in the file (your choices are specific to the numbers 1-25 in reference to user input.)

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
